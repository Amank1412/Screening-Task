# Python Debugging Assistant - AI Prompt Task - 2

### Quick Start

Follow these steps to use the AI debugging assistant:

1. Open [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md)  
2. Copy the prompt text  
3. Paste it into your preferred AI language model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)  
4. Append the student's buggy Python code  
5. The AI will guide the student through debugging using best practices and educational prompts

## Overview

This repository provides the AI debugging assistant prompt designed for Python Screening Task 2. It includes:

1. **prompt:** Copy from [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md) and use in any AI platform  
2. **reasoning:** Understand the prompt structure and philosophy in [`reasoning.md`](./reasoning.md)  
3. **Examples:** View practical scenarios showing how the AI provides guidance for students of different skill levels in [`Examples.md`](./Examples.md)

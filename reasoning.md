# Design Reasoning for Python Debugging Assistant Prompt

This file explains why the AI debugging prompt was written the way it was, and how it helps students improve their Python skills.

---

## Tone and Style

The AI should be **approachable, supportive, and encouraging**. The goal is to create a friendly learning environment where students feel safe experimenting with their code.  

**Key points:**
- **Collaborative:** Use phrases like “let’s think about this together” to invite discussion.  
- **Positive:** Focus on progress and learning, not mistakes.  
- **Clear and simple:** Avoid intimidating language, but explain concepts where needed.  
- **Motivational:** Encourage curiosity, testing, and exploration.

## How Guidance vs. Bug Highlighting Works

The AI emphasizes **guiding the student** more than pointing out errors directly.  

**Guidance focus:**
- Ask questions that help students reason through problems  
- Suggest debugging strategies like tracing, using print statements, or breaking problems into smaller parts  
- Encourage systematic thinking

**Error highlighting:**
- Only suggest general areas of concern if the student is stuck  
- Avoid giving the exact solution or line number  
- Always pair hints with reflective questions to promote learning

This approach ensures students **develop critical thinking and independent problem-solving skills**.

## Adapting to Skill Levels

**For Beginners:**
- Use simple, easy-to-follow language  
- Suggest small, concrete debugging steps (e.g., print variables, test simple inputs)  
- Explain basic Python concepts when necessary  

**For Advanced Learners:**
- Use technical terminology appropriately  
- Focus on logic, efficiency, and edge cases  
- Encourage thinking about code readability, best practices, and alternative solutions  

The AI can adjust its approach by looking at:
- Complexity of code structure  
- Naming and commenting style  
- The type and specificity of the student’s questions

## Additional Design Choices

1. **Question-Driven Approach:**  
   Encourages students to **think critically** rather than passively receiving answers.  

2. **Hints Instead of Solutions:**  
   Keeps the learning process active and prevents dependency on the AI for answers.  

3. **Focus on Debugging Methods:**  
   Emphasizes **process over immediate results**, teaching students to approach problems systematically.  

4. **Hands-On Encouragement:**  
   Promotes experimenting with code, testing small cases, and using Python’s tools (`type()`, `help()`) to learn actively.  

5. **Self-Reflection:**  
   Questions like “Why might this not work as expected?” help students become more aware of their reasoning process.

## Learning Philosophy

The design is inspired by:
- **Active Learning:** Students learn best when actively engaging with the material.  
- **Guided Discovery:** Providing just enough support to help students find solutions themselves.  
- **Growth Mindset:** Encouraging persistence and viewing mistakes as learning opportunities.

## Indicators of Effectiveness

The prompt will be effective if students:
1. Debug their code more confidently  
2. Ask thoughtful questions and reflect on their approach  
3. Develop repeatable strategies for solving problems  
4. Understand why errors occur, not just how to fix them  
5. Improve their independence as programmers
